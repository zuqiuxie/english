intro:
    The taskset command is used to set or retrieve the CPU affinity
    of a running process given its pid, or to launch a new command
    with a given CPU affinity.
plugins:
    - copyCode

Getting Started {.cols-3}
--------

### Usage 
The default behavior is to run a new command with a given affinity mask
```shell
$ taskset [mask] [command] [arguments]
```

#### Usage #2
```shell
$ taskset -p [pid]
```
---------
```shell
$ taskset -p [mask] [pid]
```
You can also retrieve the CPU affinity of an existing task


 ### Common Options {.col-span-2}
| Command | Alternavite  | Meaning                                                                                                                                                  |   
|---------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-a`    | --all-tasks  | Set or retrieve the CPU affinity of all the task (threads) for a given PID.                                                                              |
| `-c`    | --cpu-list   | Interpret mask as numerical list of processors instead of a bitmask.</br>Numbers are separated by commas and may include ranges. For example: `0,5,8-11` |
| `-p`    | --pid        | Operate on an existing PID and do not launch a new task.                                                                                                 |
| `-h`    | --help       | Display help text and exit.                                                                                                                              |
| `-v`    | --version    | Print version and exit.                                                                                                                                  |

Example
--------

### View CPU Affinity
```shell
$ taskset -cp 29523
pid 29523's current affinity list: 0-15
```
That mean process with PID `29523` is active on CPU range from `[0,1,...,15]` which means `16` total.

**PID**: Process Identifier - is a unique numerical identifier given to each running process, you can view PID of processes in `top` or `htop` tools

_If you run the above command but get the message `bad usage`, try with PID = 1_

 ```shell
 $ taskset -cp 1
 ```

### Set CPU Affinity
Now let's try to set process in to a specify CPU. For example, we have a process has PID = 14846

Let's see the CPU affinity list of this process first:
```shell
$ taskset -cp 14846
pid 14846's current affinity list: 0-15
```

#### Change CPU affinity to 1:
```shell
$ taskset -cp 1 14846
pid 14846's current affinity list: 0-15
pid 14846's new affinity list: 1
```
As we see, CPU affinity was changed

### Set CPU Affinity with muliple value
That mean new CPU affinity list is `[0,1,2,3]`
```shell
$ taskset -cp 0-3 14846
pid 14846's current affinity list: 1
pid 14846's new affinity list: 0-3
```

You can set single CPU with the following command:

```shell
$ taskset -cp 5,8,12 14846
pid 14846's current affinity list: 0-3
pid 14846's new affinity list: 5,8,12
```
That mean new CPU affinity list is `[5,8,12]`

### Other
You can set affinity by range with other like a specify CPU
```shell
$ taskset -cp 1-3,12 14846
```

Or

```shell
$ taskset -cp 1-6:2 14846
```
The suffix ":N" specifies stride in the range, for example 0-10:3 is interpreted as 0,3,6,9 list.
