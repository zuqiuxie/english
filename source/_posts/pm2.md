Getting Started
---------------

### Install
The latest PM2 version is installable with NPM or Yarn
``` shell script
$ npm install pm2@latest -g
```

OR
``` shell script
$ yarn global add pm2
```


### Start an app 
The simplest way to start, daemonize and monitor your application is by using this command line
``` shell script
$ pm2 start app.js
```

Or start any other application easily
``` shell script
$ pm2 start bashscript.sh
$ pm2 start python-app.py --watch
$ pm2 start binary-file -- --port 1520
```

### Some options you can pass to the CLI {.row-span-3}

Specify an app name
``` shell script
--name <app_name>
```

Watch and Restart app when files change
``` shell script
--watch
```

Set memory threshold for app reload
``` shell script
--max-memory-restart <200MB>
```

Specify log file
``` shell script
--log <log_path>
```

Pass extra arguments to the script
``` shell script
-- arg1 arg2 arg3
```

Delay between automatic restarts
``` shell script
--restart-delay <delay in ms>
```

Prefix logs with time
``` shell script
--time
```

Do not auto restart app
``` shell script
--no-autorestart
```

Specify cron for forced restart
``` shell script
--cron <cron_pattern>
```

Attach to application log
``` shell script
--no-daemon
```


### Managing processes
Managing application state is simple here are the commands
``` shell script
$ pm2 restart app_name
$ pm2 reload app_name
$ pm2 stop app_name
$ pm2 delete app_name
```

#### Instead of app_name you can pass

- `all` to act on all processes
- `id` to act on a specific process id
 

### Check status, logs, metrics {.row-span-2}

Now that you have started this application, you can check its status, logs, metrics and even get the online dashboard with [pm2.io](https://pm2.io/).

List the status of all application managed by PM2
``` shell script
$ pm2 [list|ls|status]
```

To display logs in realtime
``` shell script
$ pm2 logs
```

To dig in older logs
``` shell script
$ pm2 logs --lines 200
```

Here is a realtime dashboard that fits directly into your terminal
``` shell script
$ pm2 monit
```

Web based dashboard, cross servers with diagnostic system
``` shell script
$ pm2 plus
```


### Cluster mode
For Node.js applications, PM2 includes an automatic load balancer that will share all HTTP[s]/Websocket/TCP/UDP connections between each spawned processes.

To start an application in Cluster mode
``` shell script
$ pm2 start app.js -i max
```
Read more about cluster mode [here](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/).



### Ecosystem File {.row-span-2}

You can also create a configuration file, called Ecosystem File, to manage multiple applications. To generate an Ecosystem file
``` shell script
$ pm2 ecosystem
```

This will generate an ecosystem.config.js file
```
module.exports = {
  apps : [{
    name: "app",
    script: "./app.js",
    env: {
      NODE_ENV: "development",
    },
    env_production: {
      NODE_ENV: "production",
    }
  }, {
     name: 'worker',
     script: 'worker.js'
  }]
}
```

And start it easily
``` shell script
$ pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
```

### Setup startup script
Restarting PM2 with the processes you manage on server boot/reboot is critical. To solve this, just run this command to generate an active startup script
``` shell script
$ pm2 save
```

Read more about startup script generator [here](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/startup/)


### Restart application on changes
Itâ€™s pretty easy with the `--watch` option
```
$ cd /path/to/my/app
$ pm2 start env.js --watch --ignore-watch="node_modules"
```

This will watch & restart the app on any file change from the current directory + all subfolders and it will ignore any changes in the node_modules folder `--ignore-watch="node_modules"`.

You can then use `pm2 logs` to check for restarted app logs.

### CheatSheet {.row-span-2 .col-span-2}
Here are some commands that are worth knowing. Just try them with a sample application or with your current web application on your development machine

Fork mode
```shell script
$ pm2 start app.js --name my-api # Name process
```

Cluster mode
```shell script
$ pm2 start app.js -i 0        # Will start maximum processes with LB depending on available CPUs
$ pm2 start app.js -i max      # Same as above, but deprecated.
$ pm2 scale app +3             # Scales `app` up by 3 workers
$ pm2 scale app 2              # Scales `app` up or down to 2 workers total
```

Listing
```shell script
$ pm2 list               # Display all processes status
$ pm2 jlist              # Print process list in raw JSON
$ pm2 prettylist         # Print process list in beautified JSON

$ pm2 describe 0         # Display all information about a specific process

$ pm2 monit              # Monitor all processes
```

Logs
```shell script
$ pm2 logs [--raw]       # Display all processes logs in streaming
$ pm2 flush              # Empty all log files
$ pm2 reloadLogs         # Reload all logs
```

Actions
```shell script
$ pm2 stop all           # Stop all processes
$ pm2 restart all        # Restart all processes

$ pm2 reload all         # Will 0s downtime reload (for NETWORKED apps)

$ pm2 stop 0             # Stop specific process id
$ pm2 restart 0          # Restart specific process id

$ pm2 delete 0           # Will remove process from pm2 list
$ pm2 delete all         # Will remove all processes from pm2 list
```

Misc
```shell script
$ pm2 reset <process>    # Reset meta data (restarted time...)
$ pm2 updatePM2          # Update in memory pm2
$ pm2 ping               # Ensure pm2 daemon has been launched
$ pm2 sendSignal SIGUSR2 my-app # Send system signal to script
$ pm2 start app.js --no-daemon
$ pm2 start app.js --no-vizion
$ pm2 start app.js --no-autorestart
```


### Updating PM2
We made it simple, there is no breaking change between releases and the procedure is straightforward
```shell script
$ npm install pm2@latest -g
```
Then update the in-memory PM2
```shell script
$ pm2 update
```
